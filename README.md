# React + Vite Frontend Template

This repository provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. It includes two official plugins for Fast Refresh:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Allows you to update modules in the application without a full reload.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.0.0 or higher)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server and open your application in the browser. The default URL is usually `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with a production-ready build of your application.

## Linting

To lint your code using ESLint, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```
